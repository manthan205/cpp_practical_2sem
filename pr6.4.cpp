First Part — Problem
Title: Memory Leak Issue in Hierarchical Object Deletion
Developers face memory leaks when deleting derived class objects through base class pointers because destructors of derived classes are not called.
Problem arises due to missing virtual destructors in the base class, causing dynamically allocated resources to remain undeleted.
Main Concept: Inheritance, destructor behavior, memory leaks due to missing virtual destructors.
